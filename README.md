cync2mqtt in docker configured for HASS-OS
### I wouldn't use this if I were you. It currently works for me, but was quickly hacked together on breaks at work. My HASS Addon experience is essentially 0, as is my DOCKERFILE understanding. At bare minimum, it is super sloppy with lots of vestigial elements from the project I forked this from. At worst it will inhibit your HASS instance.
